e-Mitra School and College Payment Portal
Problem Statement
These are few problems that we are facing in the current scenario :-

Fees of the government school and colleges are paid either by cash or by demand draft and in many cases parents don’t have time to go bank and apply for the demand draft and or go to school and deposit cash or sometimes there is a problem of insufficient cash at home.

Another problem is that, many private schools and colleges have their own portal for fee submission but still their is lack of transparency in this procedure and private schools and colleges collecting large amount of fees from the parents.

Similarly, As the case of private schools and colleges private hospitals are also taking a large amount of money for the patient's treatment and their too is the problem of lack of transparency.

Solution
We find the solution of this problem with the help of E - MITRA portal. We will connect all the payment procedure of either the the education sector, health sector or any other with the current E - MITRA portal. So, it is convenient for the parents to pay the fees of their wards from home and also it will save their time. The another advantage of this solution is that now all the transactions of private school fees and private hospitals are done via E - MITRA portal so every payment is under surveillance of the government. This will also helps government to find the organizations who are saving taxes by some other means.

Advantages
Public Convenience
Transparency
Growth in Revenue Collection
This will also helps in reducing corruption in the most essential sectors of the masses.
It will help out gov to keep track of the record very easily so with this information it would be ease for the gov. To plan out the next budget and make proper amendments in rules and policies.
Why it is Unique?
Through our solution, all the transactions by all the private or government educational and health sector will be done via government portal, currently there is no such system through which government can track any unfair charge i.e practically on ground level we see that the citizens are being unfairly charged by these essential sectors. The government will get the true data of income of these sectors so everything in system will get transparent, eventually corruption in these sectors will exponentially reduce. Through this the government will have the track that how much their citizens are spending in education and health, so it will help government to plan the future policies and budgets. So by our solution,the mass amount of people will get benefited and will get the easy, digital and secure way of making payments .
